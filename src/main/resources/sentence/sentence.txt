They started in the morning before it was light， and they stopped in the evening after dark.
They were all skin and bone
side by side
But the days passed without a chance for a fight
The wild animal had made its kill
Every evening he lay down the minute after the sledge stopped
I’ll show you
Do you think that load will stay on
Push it from one side to the other to break the ice
get out of my way.
he was also a man who was naturally kind to animals
Through the shallow water the gold showed like yellow butter
The worst thing about him was that he could neither take his eyes away from me，nor look straight into my fac
This was the end of all my hopes.
we are going to get on well
But my heart was beating with excitement as I walked down the road
What's mine is yours，man，and what's yours is mine
Blood's thicker than water
I thought of the danger that I had been in
Sending a stranger up those stairs in the dark was sending him straight to his death
What can I bring you back from my travels
my blood run cold when I saw him
this man managed to jump up and catch the side of the ship and pull himself up
thinking that a man with so fine a coat must like fine people
Jump in here among the trees
I had had enough
What have you been doing since then
by night the wind was growing stronger and the sailors found it hard to keep the ship away from the dangerous rocks
all the way
People are dying like flies
she was all alone
You're a hard little girl
The train journey lasted all day
you must stay out of his way and do what you're told
felt very small and lost
The room seemed dark and rather strange
she felt very confused and lonely
that would be kind of you
She counted up to a hundred as she skipped
