They started in the morning before it was light， and they stopped in the evening after dark.
They were all skin and bone
side by side
But the days passed without a chance for a fight
The wild animal had made its kill
Every evening he lay down the minute after the sledge stopped
I’ll show you
Do you think that load will stay on
Push it from one side to the other to break the ice
get out of my way.
